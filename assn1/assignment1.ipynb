It's optimized to deal with large vector operations with some SUPER advanced C optimizations (you learn a little about it in COMPSCI 61C). \n","\n","NumPy is used in place of Python arrays both because Python arrays tend to be slower for operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and because of the fact that Python arrays are can contain multiple types of objects. Normally, this is a good thing, but for fast array operations, type checking every single element of a list can be very time-intensive. Thus, Numpy is the go to library for machine learning data analysis and transformation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6nFqIsUzhyG6"},"source":["Convention is to use \"np\" as an alias for numpy during an import.
